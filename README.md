## Assigments Problems
The purpose of the data set is to predict diagnostically whether a patient has diabetes (Class 1) or does not represent a person with diabetes (Class 0), based on certain diagnostic measures as features included in the data set. The Pima Indians Diabetes dataset consists of several medical parameters and one target parameter (outcome) of binary values 0 and 1. This dataset is mainly for predicting gender. Female at least 21 years old of Pima Indian descent.

## Dataset Information 
URL Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database

The Indian pima hereditary diabetes diagnostic dataset consists of 9 columns with 8 feature parameters, 1 target parameter with unique identification 768 observations having 268 positive for diabetes (1) and 500 negative for diabetes (0). The nine columns are as follows:

- Pregnancies : Pregnancy is one of the conditions used to describe the period when the fetus is developing in the womb. In determining the diagnosis of diabetes, the patient is seen by the history of how many times he has had pregnancy.
- Glucose: The oral glucose tolerance test is an examination that measures the body's ability to absorb sugar (glucose) after the patient consumes a certain amount of sugar. The results of this test can help doctors diagnose diabetes, including gestational diabetes that occurs in pregnant women. Blood Pressure: Blood pressure is a measure of the force used by the heart to pump blood throughout the body. See the results of the measurement of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure numbers on the blood pressure gauge per (mmHg). Normal blood pressure minimizes the patient's diabetes, and vice versa.
- Skin Thickness: The thickness of the deep triceps skin fold (mm). Diabetics need a long time to control blood sugar well, poor blood supply to the skin can cause changes in the collagen and fat underneath. The overlying skin becomes thin and red.
- Insulin: Insulin injections are used before meals or at night before going to bed to keep blood sugar levels stable. For each type of 2-hour serum insulin injection (mu U/ml), the patient's reaction to sugar levels was seen.
- BMI: Measurement to determine healthy and unhealthy weight groups. The accuracy between the patient's weight (kg) and the patient's height (m2).
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: History of diabetes in yourself and your closest family (who have a genetic relationship with the patient).
- Age: The age of the patient (years).
- Outcome: Class 1 indicates people with diabetes and class 0 does not have diabetes or live a healthy life.

## Supervised learning-Machine Learning
Supervised learning is an approach to creating artificial intelligence (AI), where a computer algorithm is trained on input data that has been labeled for a particular output. The model is trained until it can detect the underlying patterns and relationships between the input data and the output labels, enabling it to yield accurate labeling results when presented with never-before-seen data.

Supervised learning is good at classification and regression problems, such as determining what category a news article belongs to or predicting the volume of sales for a given future date. In supervised learning, the aim is to make sense of data within the context of a specific question.

According to WHO, Diabetes is a chronic, metabolic disease characterized by elevated levels of blood glucose (or blood sugar), which leads over time to serious damage to the heart, blood vessels, eyes, kidneys and nerves. The most common is type 2 diabetes, usually in adults, which occurs when the body becomes resistant to insulin or doesn`t make enough insulin. In the past three decades the prevalence of type 2 diabetes has risen dramatically in countries of all income levels. Type 1 diabetes, once known as juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes, is a chronic condition in which the pancreas produces little or no insulin by itself. For people living with diabetes, access to affordable treatment, including insulin, is critical to their survival. There is a globally agreed target to halt the rise in diabetes and obesity by 2025.

## Process Concept Completion
Supervised learning (SL) is the machine learning task of learning a function that maps an input to an output based on example input-output pairs. It infers a function from labeled training data consisting of a set of training examples.

Then the supervised learning analysis is carried out with several algorithms as follows:

Preprocessing: Able to do dataset preprocessing before doing the modeling process (split data, normalization, encoding, etc.)
Logistic Regression: Implement Logistic Regression and determine the right hyperparameters with Scikit-Learn
SVM: Implements Logistic Regression and determines the right hyperparameters with Scikit-Learn
Decision Tree: Implement Decision Tree and determine the right hyperparameters with Scikit-Learn
Random Forest : Implement Decision Tree and determine the right hyperparameter with Scikit-Learn
K-Nearest Neighbor : Implements KNN and determines the right hyperparameter with Scikit-Learn
Cross Validation: Implementing Cross Validation with Scikit-Learn
Grid Search : Implementing Grid Search with Scikit-Learn
Model Inference: Trying out a model that has been created with new data
