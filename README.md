The Indian pima hereditary diabetes diagnostic dataset consists of 9 columns with 8 feature parameters, 1 target parameter with unique identification 768 observations having 268 positive for diabetes (1) and 500 negative for diabetes (0). The nine columns are as follows:

- Pregnancies : Pregnancy is one of the conditions used to describe the period when the fetus is developing in the womb. In determining the diagnosis of diabetes, the patient is seen by the history of how many times he has had pregnancy.
- Glucose: The oral glucose tolerance test is an examination that measures the body's ability to absorb sugar (glucose) after the patient consumes a certain amount of sugar. The results of this test can help doctors diagnose diabetes, including gestational diabetes that occurs in pregnant women. Blood Pressure: Blood pressure is a measure of the force used by the heart to pump blood throughout the body. See the results of the measurement of the systolic and diastolic blood pressure numbers on the blood pressure gauge per (mmHg). Normal blood pressure minimizes the patient's diabetes, and vice versa.
- Skin Thickness: The thickness of the deep triceps skin fold (mm). Diabetics need a long time to control blood sugar well, poor blood supply to the skin can cause changes in the collagen and fat underneath. The overlying skin becomes thin and red.
- Insulin: Insulin injections are used before meals or at night before going to bed to keep blood sugar levels stable. For each type of 2-hour serum insulin injection (mu U/ml), the patient's reaction to sugar levels was seen.
- BMI: Measurement to determine healthy and unhealthy weight groups. The accuracy between the patient's weight (kg) and the patient's height (m2).
- Diabetes Pedigree Function: History of diabetes in yourself and your closest family (who have a genetic relationship with the patient).
- Age: The age of the patient (years).
- Outcome: Class 1 indicates people with diabetes and class 0 does not have diabetes or live a healthy life.
